## Goals of this class

* How to take take a programming class
* How to mentor others to help them learn how to program
* Free & open materials , everything here is free to share

###Chapter 1 Why Program?/ Hardware Basics/About Python

*python has reserved words:
  + AND
  + DEL
  + FOR
  + IS
  + RAISE
  + BREAK
  + ASSERT
  + ELIF
  + FROM
  + LAMBDA
  + RETURN
  + ELSE
  + GLOBAL
  + NOT
  + TRY
  + CLASS
  + EXCEPT
  + IF
  + OR
  + WHILE
  + CONTINUE
  + EXEC
  + IMPORT
  + PASS
  + YIELD
  + DEF

  + IN
  + PRINT

### Chapter 2 Variables and Expressions
 * /** power of operator 4**3
 * integer division truncates 9/2 yields 4 ( unless you make it a float)

### Chapter 2.2 Types

* traceback  is a py error. python's way of saying "i'm lost, i don't understand what you're trying to do."
* type() will tell you the type of a variable
* raw_input()  built in function, takes a string, issues a prompt, waits for input, converts input to a string
* use "#" to comment in python

### Chapter 3.1 Conditional Execution

* < less than
* < = less than or equal to
* > greater than
* >= greater than or equal to
* == equal to
* != not equal to

* INDENTATION IS SUPER DUPER IMPORTANT IN PYTHON

### Chapter 3.2 Examples of Conditional Statements

* if x<2: 
    print small
  elif x< 10: 
    print medium
  else:
    print large

### Chapter 3.3 Try and Except
 
* used to protect from dangerous code
* try to have as little in "try" as possible, so you know what has failed when you get an error msg in your code.
